# Privado-tasks
Given tasks-
Task 1. Create a simple timer using HTML, CSS and JS with mentioned functionalities.
Solution- I've made a stopwatch with 'Privado Timer' as a heading and this stopwatch has a clearInterval time of 5 minutes thus after that time the timer will automatically reset itelf to the initial state along with the buttton text.
Task 2. Create a board game with box not colliding with the surrounding.
Solution- I've made a game where new obstacles will keep coming around the box and once it collides with any of them, game will terminate. Controls are simple keyboard controls for up, down, right and left whereas I've also added extra written buttons near the game area with same control functionalities when clicked on.
